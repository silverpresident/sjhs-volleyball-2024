I need to implement a custom authentication system in the App project  with the following requirements:
Controller Requirements
Create an AccountController with the following actions:

Login (GET & POST) - Custom login view and logic
Logout (POST) - Sign out functionality
ExternalLogin - Handle Google OAuth callback
AccessDenied - Show when authorization fails

Authentication Setup

Configure ASP.NET Core Identity with Entity Framework Core
Set up Google OAuth as the primary authentication method
Use the configuration in appsettings.json for Google ClientId and ClientSecret
Configure authentication services in AuthenticationExtensions.cs

View Requirements
Create a custom Login view (Views/Account/Login.cshtml) with:

A prominent "Sign in with Google" button as the primary option
A clean, modern design (use Bootstrap if already in the project)
traditional username/password form as a secondary option
Proper anti-forgery token handling
Return URL preservation for redirects after login

Important Constraints

DO NOT scaffold the default Identity UI
DO NOT use Identity default views or Razor Pages
Keep all authentication logic in the AccountController using standard MVC patterns
Ensure proper security practices (anti-forgery tokens, secure redirects, etc.)
You can use the Identity services

Additional Notes

Include necessary using statements and dependencies
Add appropriate authorization attributes where needed
Provide clear comments in the code
Include instructions for obtaining Google OAuth credentials in comments

Please implement this step by step, starting with the authentication configuration, then the controller, and finally the view.

====
In the admin area create a COntroller and Aciotns to manage users.
The controller should enable list all users and their roles (available to all users).
An admin user should be able to add, edit, enable and disblae users. The email address and display name is the bear miminum that should required. Anything else need should be generated by the system.
